#### 4. Set Breakpoints

- Open the file you want to debug.
- Click in the gutter to the left of the line numbers to set a breakpoint. A red dot will appear indicating the breakpoint.

#### 5. Start Debugging

- Go to the Run and Debug view.
- Select the appropriate configuration from the dropdown (e.g., `Launch Program`).
- Click the green play button to start debugging.

### Key Debugging Features in VS Code

#### 1. Breakpoints

- **Standard Breakpoints:** Set by clicking in the gutter next to the line numbers.
- **Conditional Breakpoints:** Right-click on a breakpoint and select `Edit Breakpoint...` to add a condition.
- **Logpoints:** Right-click on a breakpoint and select `Logpoint...` to log messages without pausing execution.

#### 2. Debug Console

- **Evaluate Expressions:** Enter expressions in the Debug Console to evaluate them in the current context.
- **Log Output:** View output from `console.log`, `print`, or other logging functions.

#### 3. Call Stack

- **View Call Stack:** Inspect the call stack to see the sequence of function calls that led to the current point in execution.
- **Navigate Call Stack:** Click on stack frames to navigate to the corresponding source code.

#### 4. Variables

- **Watch Variables:** Add variables to the Watch pane to monitor their values.
- **View Local Variables:** See local variables and their values in the Variables pane.
- **View Global Variables:** Expand the Global scope to see global variables.

#### 5. Step Controls

- **Continue:** Resume program execution (`F5`).
- **Step Over:** Execute the next line of code, but do not step into functions (`F10`).
- **Step Into:** Step into the function call at the current line (`F11`).
- **Step Out:** Step out of the current function (`Shift+F11`).
- **Restart:** Restart the debugging session.
- **Stop:** Stop the debugging session.

#### 6. Inline Values

- **Inline Values:** See the values of variables directly in the editor next to the code.

### Example Workflow: Debugging a Simple Node.js Application

1. **Install the Node.js Extension:**
   - Open the Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X`).
   - Search for `Node.js` and install the `Debugger for Chrome` extension.

2. **Open Project:**
   - Open your Node.js project folder.

3. **Configure Debugger:**
   - Create a `launch.json` file with the Node.js configuration:
     ```json
     {
       "version": "0.2.0",
       "configurations": [
         {
           "type": "node",
           "request": "launch",
           "name": "Launch Program",
           "skipFiles": ["<node_internals>/**"],
           "program": "${workspaceFolder}/app.js"
         }
       ]
     }
     ```

4. **Set Breakpoints:**
   - Open `app.js`.
   - Click in the gutter to set breakpoints at desired lines.

5. **Start Debugging:**
   - Go to the Run and Debug view.
   - Select `Launch Program
   
10. Using Source Control:
    - How can users integrate Git with VS Code for version control? Describe the process of initializing a repository, making commits, and pushing changes to GitHub.

### Initializing a Repository

1. **Open VS Code:**
   - Open your project folder in VS Code.

2. **Initialize Git Repository:**
   - Open the Source Control view by clicking the Source Control icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window or by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+G`.
   - Click on the `Initialize Repository` button or run the `git init` command in the integrated terminal.

### Making Commits

1. **Stage Changes:**
   - In the Source Control view, you'll see a list of changed files. Click the `+` icon next to a file to stage it for commit.

2. **Write Commit Message:**
   - Enter a commit message in the text field at the top of the Source Control view to describe your changes.

3. **Commit Changes:**
   - Click the checkmark icon to commit your changes. Alternatively, press `Ctrl+Enter`.

### Pushing Changes to GitHub

1. **Add Remote Repository:**
   - If you haven't already, create a repository on GitHub.
   - Copy the repository URL (e.g., `https://github.com/username/repository.git`).

2. **Add Remote Origin:**
   - In the integrated terminal, add the remote repository as the origin:
     ```bash
     git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repository.git
     ```

3. **Push Changes:**
   - Push your committed changes to GitHub:
     ```bash
     git push -u origin master
     ```
   - Replace `master` with the branch you want to push to if you're using a different branch.

4. **Enter GitHub Credentials:**
   - If prompted, enter your GitHub username and password or personal access token to authenticate the push.

### Key Git Features in VS Code

#### 1. Source Control View

- View and manage changes, stage files, commit changes, and view commit history.

#### 2. Git Graph

- Visualize the commit history graphically to understand branch relationships and commit timelines.

#### 3. Integrated Terminal

- Run Git commands directly in the integrated terminal to manage your repository.

#### 4. GitLens Extension

- Enhances the Git capabilities in VS Code with features like blame annotations, commit history exploration, and more.

### Example Workflow

1. **Initialize Repository:**
   - Open your project in VS Code.
   - Initialize a Git repository by clicking the `Initialize Repository` button in the Source Control view.

2. **Make Changes:**
   - Modify files in your project.

3. **Stage Changes:**
   - In the Source Control view, stage the changes by clicking the `+` icon next to the modified files.

4. **Commit Changes:**
   - Enter a commit message in the text field at the top of the Source Control view.
   - Click the checkmark icon to commit the changes.

5. **Push Changes to GitHub:**
   - Add the GitHub repository as the remote origin.
   - Push the committed changes to GitHub.
